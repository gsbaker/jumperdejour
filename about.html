    <p>Hi. We're George and Mark, the founders of Jumper de Jour.</p>
    <p>We started this company because, well, we love jumpers.</p>
    <p>But, we found it difficult to find cashmere jumpers that were a bit more
    fun and interesting.</p>
    <p>So, we decided to make our own.</p>
    <p>Currently, Jumper de Jour is just a vision. A fun little side-project
    that might turn into something more serious one day.</p>
    <p>But if you like the idea of fun, interesting cashmere jumpers, please
    get in touch and register your interest on the <a href="/">home
      page</a>.</p>
